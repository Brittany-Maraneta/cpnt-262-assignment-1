# CPNT 262 Assignment 1 Bring a webpage to life

## Brittany Maraneta

### Overview Choices

- Rendered images in client.JS is with the carousel = lines 44 - 85
- Toggle 1 is for the dark and light mode in client.js (lines 19 - 21) & index.html (lines 26 - 30)
- Toggle 2 is with the hamburger menu on always in client.js (lines 10 - 22) and index.html (lines 16 - 31)
- main.css was made instead of using tailwinds only to really be able to practice but next assignment I will to tailwinds
- loop was used for the carousels to loop through the images always
- conditional was used for my scroll button with an if statement of when its pressed or scrolled, as well as the toggle button for dark or light mode for the site.

### Code Journal

Bugs I went through were a lot, only because I felt the more I added content the more I broke it easily! The big main one, was the carousel it took me days to figure out why the loop kept breaking so I had to restart a few times. The biggest thing was I had to go very step by step and right down what am I doing for this carousel, I created the images list, made it a gallery, added buttons so it moved, then researched the loop function to be able to add it on and finally remove the buttons as it became a look then functional.

Another bug I came upon on was figuring out how to add the alt section in images in JS as it kept breaking for some reason. I believe I was putting it in incorrectly, so I reached out to Temi for support and my peers to see how they do the images list in js instead of css and it really was just my organization and set up!

### Resources

- w3schools helped me with being able to figure out how to create the contact chat box and I was able to reference how it was built and why
- the hackathon we did really helped me as I asked Temi and peers a lot about how to function JS into my code and to be able to just have a full day of support and ask questions when we get stuck was amazing.
- Planning helped me a lot too, just being able to see how it will look and what the idea will be so that I can go step by step easy!

### Things to fix in the future

- Figure out why my body height can be edited to be smaller or longer but when I do it mobile, it just doesn't work.
- The carousel has some kind of delay when you're on the page, so how would I make sure it loads right away and doesn't have a delay when it loops.
